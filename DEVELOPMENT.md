# Development

This document describes the process for running this application on your local computer.

## Getting started

This project uses .NET to automatically generate the models used in the Java client.

To run the generator you need to have .NET 7 or newer installed on your machine. [Download .NET 7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)

Then to generate the models and clients of the SDK run `generate.ps1` if you're on Windows, else run `generate.sh`.
## Development experience
For the best experience with developing on the SDK we recommend to use a dedicated Java IDE.
