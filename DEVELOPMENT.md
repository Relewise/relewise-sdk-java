This document describes the process for running this application on your local computer.

## Getting started

This project uses a NPM tool to automatically generate the models used in the Java client.

To run the generator you need to have Node installed on your machine. [Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Then to generate the models and clients of the SDK run `generate.ps1` if you're on Windows, else run `generate.sh`.
